Step 1 – Ask the user to input a number, userInput
Step 2 – Check if the number is less than or equals to 1. If so, it isn’t a prime number. 
Step 3 – If the number is NOT less than or equal to 1, iterate through all the possible divisors (from 2 till userInput– 1)
Step 4 – Within the loop, calculate the remainder of UserInput divided by the ForLoopIndex using the MOD function. If equal to 0 at any point, the number is not prime.  ( n % i ==0)
Step 5 – If the loop ends and no divisors are found, the number is prime.
